My research interests are on the modeling, optimization and control of networked cyber-physical systems. 
Specifically, I would like to understand the structral properties of the control and optimization in power systems,
and to use such structral properties to guide the designing of new algorithms.
Here are some core questions I pose to myself.

<section>
	<h4>&#8226 How to characterize some 'easy' non-convex optimization problems?</h1>
	Beyond problems in power systems, there are tremendous engineering problems that are non-convex and thus NP-hard in general.
	However, in practice many efficient algorithms are actually able to find the global optima for the majority of problem instances.
	Those algorithms include convex relaxation and local-search methods such as gradient descent. 
	In this project, we extract some common features of those problems which satisfy both: 
	(1) convex relaxation is exact; (2) local optima are gloablly optimal.
	Such common features turn out to be the existence of some potential function satisfying certain conditions.
	It is very interesting that for many problems including OPF, optimal charging scheduling, SDP with rank constraints, 
	such potential function can be easily (and naturally) found or constructed.
	We hope this result can open up a new perspective to characterize some 'easy' non-convex problems.
	See our <a href="/easy_opt.pdf">recent article</a>.

	<h4>&#8226 What is the effect of power demand on the optimal generation allocation in power systems?</h1>
	The sensitivity of the generation w.r.t. the load reflects how power demand affects the optimal generation in economic dispatch problems.
	We found that low sensitivity helps preserve the differential privacy of power system data, 
	and decreases the tracking error of real-time primal dual algorithm.
	The sensitivity is closely related to the topology of power network.
	We proposed an algorithm to compute the worst-case sensitivity for certain network topologies, 
	and showed that the computation for larger networks can be decomposed into the analysis on smaller network components.
	Please check our <a href="/ACC2020_final.mp4">video</a> for ACC2020, which demonstrates this decomposition procedure.

	<h4>&#8226 How to extend the convex relaxation to distributed power systems with multi-phases, in the presence of both Y and &#916 devices?</h1>
	Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems are non-convex, and NP-hard in genral. 
	For single-phase networks, it was known that convex relaxation is usually exact in both theory and practice, under certain conditions.
	However, there was little analytical work on the exactness for multi-phase networks and even in practice, 
	the relaxation method was restrictive to networks with Y devices only.
	We first propose the sufficient conditions, though still restrictive in many ways, that provably guarantees the exactness for multi-phase networks.
	In addition, we also develop new methodologies to relax networks with both Y and &#916 devices.
	Our new methodologies can efficiently find the global optima for all the IEEE test cases (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07803">paper</a>).
